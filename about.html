                    <h2>What is Mardi Gras ?</h2>

                    <p>Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning
                        on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day
                        before
                        Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday.</p>
                    <p> Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting
                        the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices
                        and
                        fasting of the Lenten season.</p>

                    <p> Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and
                        religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent.</p>
                    <p> In countries such as the
                        United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word
                        shrive,
                        meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve"</p>
                    <p>Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of spring and
                        fertility such as Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC. This celebration honored the god of
                        agriculture, Saturn. It was observed in mid-December, before the sowing of winter crops. It was
                        a
                        week-long festival when work and business came to a halt. Schools and courts of law closed, and
                        the
                        normal social patterns were suspended.</p>
                    <p>On the Julian calendar, which the Romans used at the time, the winter solstice fell on December
                        25.
                        Hence, the celebration gradually became associated with Christmas.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in
                        the
                        17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry
                        of
                        "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.

                        On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at
                        a
                        plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when
                        his
                        men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                        Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la
                        Mobile
                        celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.</p>

                <div class="about-par">
                    <p>In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form
                        our
                        current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed
                        and
                        paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on
                        wheels
                        by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming
                        Lenten
                        meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

                        New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly
                        in
                        New
                        Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                        Marquis
                        de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans
                        Mardi
                        Gras
                        balls of today.</p>

                <div class="about-par">
                    <p>The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                        governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                        hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.

                        By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                        riders to
                        celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's
                        members
                        and
                        lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives
                        formed
                        the
                        Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
                        brought
                        magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls.
                        Krewe
                        members remained anonymous.</p>

                    <h2>Mardigras Traditions</h2>
                    <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                        Orleans!

                        Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn
                        themselves
                        with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes,
                        kids
                        with their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade
                        goers
                        will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by
                        between
                        parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of
                        the
                        celebration.

                        Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                        trinkets they will catch from the parades!

                        Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have
                        changed.

                    <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
                    <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor
                        of
                        New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the
                        office. <br> Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City
                        Council from
                        2012–2018. <br>
                        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend
                        Xavier
                        University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.br She attended an executive
                        training
                        program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
                        Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. <br> In 2003,
                        she
                        joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the
                        association in
                        2004. After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the
                        Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. <br>
                        In early
                        2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by then-mayor Ray
                        Nagin,
                        released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to
                        be
                        converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with
                        residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She
                        also
                        helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for
                        the
                        neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>
                        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                        fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of
                        the
                        Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor Development
                        Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case management and other social
                        services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's
                        Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a
                        partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                        provided the neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also
                        formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed
                        Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.
                        Political career
                        New Orleans City Council
                        In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when
                        former
                        District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November
                        election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won
                        with
                        54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a
                        full four-year term in 2014.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                        introduced a bill banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health
                        effects of secondhand smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill
                        in 2015.</p>
                    <p>
                        Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was
                        objected
                        to by residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the
                        shelter
                        was moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced
                        legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in
                        the
                        city.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install
                        crime
                        cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and
                        address understaffing at the New Orleans Police Department.</p>

                        Main article: 2017 New Orleans mayoral election
                        Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                        term-limited mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18
                        candidates. Cantrell garnered the most votes, winning 39% of the total.[24] In the November 18
                        runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a former
                        municipal
                        judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New Orleans in its 300-year
                        history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.</p>

                        Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the
                        city's
                        history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                        creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun
                        Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push
                        to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her
                        #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and
                        green
                        spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
                        against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.</p>
                    <p>
                        During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                        Agreement
                        with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50
                        million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual
                        recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans
                        voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in
                        the
                        2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
                        properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home
                        Rule
                        Charter.</p>
                    <p>
                        Awards
                        In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and
                        Xavier universities and the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.
