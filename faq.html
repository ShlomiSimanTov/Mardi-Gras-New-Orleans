            <button class="accordion">1: Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe
                    the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
                    website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to
                    those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi
                    Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the
                    country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
                    Orleans.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">2: When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras
                    day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                    Wednesday.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">3: What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I
                pack?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                    change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
                    since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                    somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll
                    definitely want to bring a raincoat!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">4: How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we
                    call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">5: I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi
                Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the
                    weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets
                    of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can
                    stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience
                    Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                    festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
                    costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">6: What happens if there is bad weather?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be
                    severe. The local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.

                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">7: Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who
                    grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every
                    parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large
                    garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals,
                    beads, and more.

                    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                    anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since
                    parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles
                    is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having
                    picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
                    the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                    You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which
                    is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
                    weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">8: What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've arrived?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car
                    depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">9: Where should I go if someone needs CPR or first aid during a parade?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Red Cross volunteers, in partnership with New Orleans first responders, will be providing basic first
                    aid in some of the most populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained in CPR and first
                    aid and will assist the ill and injured at each of their stations positioned along the parade
                    routes.

                    First aid stations will be available on the following corners along St. Charles Avenue during many
                    of our larger parades the last two weeks of Mardi Gras season:

                    Canal Street | Napoleon Avenue | Washington Avenue | Felicity Street | Lee Circle
                    Additionally, first aid stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy Street, as
                    well as North Carrolton Avenue and Bienville Street on the Saturday before Mardi Gras for the
                    Endymion parade.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">10: When and where do the Mardi Gras Indians parade?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the Sunday
                    closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                    The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner-city
                    neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of
                    LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other
                    tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade.

                    The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of
                    March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington &
                    LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take
                    to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                    For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

                    Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the
                    Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years,
                    there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open
                    weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on these
                    events at this time.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">11: Should we purchase seats for a Grandstand, like the parade reviewing stands on
                St. Charles Avenue? How can I get tickets?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people at the parades will be standing or
                    even jumping for throws—and in between parades, people are walking around and popping into local
                    restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands for people who may have trouble standing
                    or walking for longer than an hour at a time.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">12: Do I need to buy Mardi Gras beads and merchandise before my visit?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Not unless you are going to be a rider on a float. If you plan to watch the parades during Mardi
                    Gras, you'll catch so much you won't be able to carry it all!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">13: How can I find out what this year's Mardi Gras theme will be?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single organization in charge of
                    Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret until
                    the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if
                    they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were popular.

                    Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are
                    named after the neighborhood where they parade.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">12: Can a brand, organization, or nonprofit advertise on a Mardi Gras
                float?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>There is a city ordinance in Orleans Parish that prohibits Mardi Gras from being commercialized,
                    i.e., no advertising is allowed on floats or can be thrown from floats. In addition, some of the
                    Mardi Gras organizations have events outside of their actual parade where sponsors can participate.
                    These include Zulu’s Lundi Gras Festival, Endymion’s big bash before their parade, Metairie’s
                    “Family Gras”, and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of our parades (such as Bacchus,
                    Endymion, Orpheus).</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">13: How can my dance team march in a parade?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Most krewes book talent between August and November. If there's a particular krewe you would like to
                    march with let us know and we'll connect you with the right person.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Arthur Hardy's Mardi Gras Guide is a print publication found in most drug stores that includes more
                    than 50 individual parade profiles and maps. </p>
